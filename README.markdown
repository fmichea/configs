=======================================

First of all, thank you for reading this README file. I am writting this
because I would like to thank some people, and help you configure your own
system using these files.

Introduction - Global Structure
-------------------------------

This repository is mostly composed of dot-files. They are intended to configure
softwares like *zsh*, *awesome wm* or *vim*. A lot of this files include stuff
missing of this repository. These are either softwares or specific system
configuration file (names *stuff_opt*).

Specific configuration files are included only if present, and permits you to
add configuration on several computers without pushing it to your repository.

The following list is a list of programs used by the configuration and
configured at the time I am writing this README. I'll try to keep it updated.

### Configured

* awesome WM - Window Manager - http://awesome.naquadah.org/
* zsh - Powerful shell - http://www.zsh.org/
* bash - Another shell
* emacs - Text editor - http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
* vim - Text editor
* git - DCVS
* mercurial - DCVS - http://mercurial.selenic.com/
* rxvt-unicode - Terminal - http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html

### Used

* synclient - Synaptics driver options
* feh - Sets wallpaper

Obviously, any of the programs used are not mandatory. They are only used by
the configuration and you can replace them whenever you want.

Special Thanks
--------------

If I wanted to thank every author of every article I read to help me write this
configuration, I would be really embarrassed. But I can especially thank these
people:

* anrxc and tdy for there awesome configuration, found on awesome's wiki. They
  really helped me build mine.
* delroth, for his vim configuration. I saved a lot of time "forking" his own
  configuration to build mine.
