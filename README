		README for kushou's configuration files

First of all, thank you for reading this README. This is written because I like
to respect licences, and help people to find good things to read to configure
their own system. You have to know that this configuration is running on Arch64
(on both desktop and laptop) and on a Fedora 11 (but everything isn't used
everywhere obviously).

Here is the list of software I use:
 * awesome WM - http://awesome.naquadah.org/
 * bash - http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html
 * emacs - http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
 * mercurial - http://mercurial.selenic.com/
 * rxvt-unicode (a.k.a. urxvt) - http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html
 * zsh (usually) - http://www.zsh.org/
 * feh - Background wallpaper - 

If you're thinking about « that .zsh_opt included in .zsh configuration file,
but missing on the repository », the answer is that it is a specific system
configuration file. I am using this configurations on 3 different systems, and
one in particular is using several configuration that are secret/unique. There
place isn't on the repository. It is on the system, in a different configuration
file included if existing, .zsh_opt.

Now, the big part, awesome configuration. For this, I have used vicious, which
is written in LUA by Adrian "anrxc" C. . I also used a lot of his icon set and
his configuration file, and I used also tdy's configuration. Thanks for both of
them.
