		README for kushou's configuration files

First of all, thank you for reading this README file. It is written because I
like to respect licences, and help you configure your own system. You have to
know that this configuration is running on two Arch64 (on a laptop and a
desktop) and on a Fedora 11, but everything isn't used everywhere.

Here is the list of softwares I use:
 * awesome WM - Window Manager - http://awesome.naquadah.org/
 * zsh - Powerful shell - http://www.zsh.org/
 * bash - Other shell - http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html
 * emacs - editor - http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
 * mercurial - DCVS - http://mercurial.selenic.com/
 * rxvt-unicode - term - http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html
 * feh - Background Wallpaper - http://freshmeat.net/projects/feh/
 * vicious - Widget Lib. - http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/

About my .zshrc, there is an include at its end, of a file that isn't included
in the repository. It's a specific system configuration file. If you want to had
some features, and don't want to up it on a repository, you should add these
features in the ~/.zsh_opt.

About the .commonzshrc file, it's a configuration used on both zsh and bash. It
contains my aliases, or so, and implies that they are indeed available on both
shells, and are exactly the same.

About my awesome conf, I want to thank anrxc and tdy for their configurations
found on https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/User_Configuration_Files. My work is
mostly inspired by their work, you should take a look at their own
configuration. The icons are from anrxc configuration, I just recentered them,
and get it in grey.
